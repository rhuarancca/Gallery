## About The Project
  
This Sample Application was developed by using Jetpack Compose. MVVM architecture and best practice are followed. You can find everything you need in the Jetpack Compose project within the application.  

  ## Architecture
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern has been used in the development of this application. The development language of the application is Kotlin.
